## First Lecture
Nadya talked about notions and gems from representation theory of GL(2) over local fields. Eitan talked about the background+introduction (using hand waving) and Section 2 of the paper.

Unfortunately, the first lecture wasn't recorded. :slightly_frowning_face:
## Second Lecture
Nadya continued her presentation of notions and gems from representation theory of GL(2) over local fields. Eitan talked about the background+introduction (less hand waving this time) and Section 2 of the paper.
